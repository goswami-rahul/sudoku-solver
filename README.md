# sudoku-solver
A basic Python3 script to solve a NxN sudoku board.

The input sudoku grid must be in a text file with grid in the following format :

The blank spaces which are to be filled are denoted by '0'
Each row is entered in a seperate line with numbers seperated by spaces.

To run the script, clone the file 'solve_sudoku.py' and run the following command :

python3  solve_sudoku.py  'path/to/input_grid.txt'  'path/to/output_sudoku.txt'

Here output_sudoku.txt is the file in which you want the output to be written.
